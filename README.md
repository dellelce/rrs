Random Readable Strings

This is some old code I used years ago to generate readable strings.

* Weight concept could be reused in graphics & other areas. : Evaluating

TODO:

* Sample main : DONE!
* General Code review  : Started
* "Randomness" improvement : Started
* more documentation (with doxygen?)

NOTES:
* targetweight (first argument of rrstest) less then 6 can generate endless loops.
